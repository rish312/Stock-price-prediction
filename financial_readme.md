## 📖 Overview
The **Financial Environment Segmentation** project focuses on identifying and classifying different market regimes using historical stock price data. This approach aids in understanding market dynamics, helping traders and investors make informed decisions.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Recognizing distinct market regimes (bull, bear, neutral) is vital for effective investment strategies. Variability in market conditions necessitates a robust framework to identify and respond to these changes promptly.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
This project employs clustering techniques to segment financial environments, providing insights into market behavior based on historical data.

| Key Components        | Description                                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Collection       | Historical stock price data gathered from Yahoo Finance.        |
| Data Preprocessing    | Calculation of daily returns, moving averages, and volatility.   |
| Feature Engineering    | Normalization and selection of relevant features for analysis.   |
| Clustering            | K-means clustering to classify market regimes.                   |
| Analysis & Validation | Evaluation of regimes and their characteristics through backtesting. |
